      So, you might be wondering what types of pastas I hate to see around. The answer: ALL OF THEM! I hate on big
      pasta, small pasta, in between pasta and sometimes even <i> pasta man </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      How did it get to this point you must ask. Well you see, when I was a young child, I lived a dreadful <u>pasta
        filled </u>life. I was constantly deeply unhappy to the point where I questioned why this life of bullying and
      carbs had befallen me. Then I <mark> burn down the country of italy </mark>. After the flames subsided, I was
      free. The grass felt greener without pasta, in reality the ground was charred.
