## **ðŸŒŽ Hello!**

<h6 style="text-align: center;"> (This is not a photo of me) </h6>

Right now I'm a full time undergraduate student in Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo. Outside of school I'm a âœ¨full-stack web developerâœ¨ at [PixelPAD.io](https://pixelpad.io), dabbling in game development and [other stuff](https://github.com/r-k-g) on my own time. In the small amount of time not taken up by the above, I cycle, play music, and sometimes even interact with other people.
