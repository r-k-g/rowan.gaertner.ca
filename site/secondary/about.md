Currently: 4 month co-op term with [North Arrow Research](https://www.northarrowresearch.com/)

Hey! Welcome to my website. Right now I'm a full time undergraduate student studying Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo. If you're interested in my work history, take a look at [my resume](/resume/) (once I upload it; sometime before September 2024). Although I'm pretty busy, when I have time and energy I like to go for bike rides, play music, enjoy photography, and spend time with friends.
