Hey! Welcome to my website. Right now I'm a full time undergraduate student studying Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo.

If you're interested in my work history, take a look at [my resume](/resume/).

So, about me: I like to make things! Mostly by programming, but occasionally also in the real world. Although I'm pretty busy, when I have time and energy I also like to go for bike rides, play music, take photos, and spend time with friends.
