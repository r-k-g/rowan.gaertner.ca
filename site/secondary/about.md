## **Hello ðŸŒŽ**
###### (It is me, Rowan)


![me](/assets/images/me.jpg)

I'm a high school senior in Vancouver BC, and Software Engineering class of 2028 at the University of Waterloo. Outside of school I'm a âœ¨full-stack web developerâœ¨ at [PixelPAD.io](https://pixelpad.io), dabbling in game development and [other stuff](https://github.com/r-k-g) on my own time. In the small amount of time not taken up by the above, I cycle, play music, and sometimes even interact with other people.
