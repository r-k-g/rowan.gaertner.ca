## **RIP ðŸŒŽ**
###### (It is me, Rowan)


![me](../assets/images/me.jpg)

Right now I'm a high school senior in Vancouver, BC. Outside of school I'm a âœ¨full-stack web developerâœ¨at [PixelPAD.io](https://pixelpad.io), also dabbling in game development and [*other stuff*](https://github.com/r-k-g) on my own time. In the small amount of time not taken up by the above, I cycle, play music, and sometimes even interact with other people.
