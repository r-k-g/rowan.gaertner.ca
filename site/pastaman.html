        So, you might be wondering what types of pasta I like to eat. The answer: ALL SORTS! I eat big pasta, small
        pasta, in between pasta and sometimes even <i>long pasta</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        How did it get to this point you must ask. Well you see, when I was a young child, I lived a <u>pasta-less
          life</u>.
        I was constantly deeply unhappy to the point where I questioned why this life of uninspired food was worth
        living.
        Then, I met pasta. <mark>Pasta changed my life</mark>. When I started eating pasta, it was as if the grass was
        greener,
        the sun brighter, and the food just <b>so much better</b>
      </p>

      <p>Now finally, you are surely questioning how you to can be more like me. It's pretty straightforward.
